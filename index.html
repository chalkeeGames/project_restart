        <h1>
      “So you’d let all life be wiped off just to teach them a lesson?” Our hero could not swallow this decision. <br><br>  </h1>
<h2>“You’re much too young to understand the workings of the universe, my child”, an elder from the council of elders said soothingly.  
<br><br>  “Or maybe <i>you</i> don’t understand the value of a life”, Eva stunned the council to silence. <br><br> 
A small smile blossoms on the faces of a young couple behind her. They crouch down and ask their little child gently, “So what do you think we should do?”<br><br>  
“If the humans are too stupid to choose a hero, then…I guess we should go choose one for them!”<br><br> 
“Never!” Another elder shakes his head furiously, his beard swinging wildly. “Our kind never interferes with the common races below us, you know it’s the only rule we follow. Our ancestors have already tried working with them many times in the past, and all they do is make us twist time to benefit themselves.”<br><br> 
“So you’d let everything die instead?!” Eva couldn’t accept this resolution.<br><br> 
“All races, especially humans, are tenacious beings. They’ll survive somehow and centuries later overthrow their dark overlord, we’ve seen it time and time again. Then once again life will be restored to the fields and the lands will prosper.”<br><br> 
“But it’s not the same life,” Eva was adamant. “All these people in the planet, each living their unique lives with their own unique troubles, they’ll be gone forever!”<br><br> 
She stops, and then says softly, “My friend will be gone forever…”<br><br>  
“So it’s actually about that elf child,” the elder looks unhappy. “This is why we don’t mix ourselves with other races, Eva,” the old man says gently. “You know better than anyone, their lives are finite. Our job is to protect the planet, not the things within it. God knows how many time-masters have tried to keep their friends and loved ones from passing but in the end it is them who suffered.” <br><br> 
“Fine, Let everything die! But tell me, without life what planet is there to protect? Isn't it just a bunch of stones and water?”<br><br>  
The elder looks at Eva quizzically. “Are you saying that there’d be no life and <i>all</i> will be lost if this creature is allowed to attack us?”<br><br> 
“Yes! And humans as we know them won’t be coming back. All living things will be turned into monsters by that creature. They’ll be alive, but…they’d be better off dead.”<br><br> 
“But that’s impossible!” the elder shakes his head in disbelief. “I’ve seen the future, humans do win eventually. Many from our clan have also seen a similar fate!”<br><br>  
“Maybe she sees a different fate than us”, Eva’s father looks to the elders. “We should let her do what she wants, first-hand experience may help her make sense of the future she sees more clearly. Who knows, maybe we are the ones missing something? Besides, this will also be a good opportunity for her to learn about the common folk and make mistakes, as we'll all be watching over her.”<br><br>  
Of course, he was sure the council wasn't missing anything; with all it’s milleniums of experience in divining they simply couldn’t make a wrong interpretation. In fact, he had himself seen the future of humanity triumphing over the creature. He just thought that this would be a good learning experience for his daughter, as the entire clan watching over her would help her if she made a mistake. <br><br>  
“B-but-!” the old man sputtered. He didn’t want to spend the next few years rectifying the time paradoxes Eva was bound to throw into the world.<br><br> 
“Then it’s decided,” Eva’s mom crouches and gives her a high-five. “You’re going on your very own adventure, Eva!”<br><br>  
Our hero’s eyes are set afire with determination. “I’ll save the world, mum! Just see!”<br><br> 
The left eye of the elder twitched wildly. If you’re just going to take decisions by yourself, is there a need for our existence?!<br><br>  
A short while later, he sighed. “Better safe than sorry,” he thought.<br><br> 
“Ahem! Very well, on behalf of the clan, I give you our blessings. Make sure to find a strong hero who can stand up to the Demon's might. O ancestors, I ask you to watch over our youngest fledgling and make sure she doesn’t cause too much trouble down there.”<br><br>  
He smiles. “We’ll all be watching over your little adventure, little one. May time go with your flow!”<br><br>
