        <h1>Plot:<br><br></h1>

<h2>The story follows Eva on her mission to defend Earth from a planet devouring creature by choosing heroes to defeat it. However, why was the hero she'd chosen suddenly attacking her? And why was everyone talking about the epic battle of NetherDemon (name to be decided) and Eva and how she... died repelling it? This is not the tale of one kid saving the world, but of the many people trying desperately to save that kid’s life. <br><br>
<b>Characters:</b><br>
(PS most of the names haven't been chosen yet, these are all placeholders atm) <br><br>
1.  Eva: A young time master, she is equal parts lazy and inquisitive. She is fascinated by living things (humans in particular) and loves travelling and watching how living beings find ways to overcome their struggles and troubles in unexpected ways. <br><br>
2.  Ren: Rescued by Eva, she was able to look past the mysticism of the latter’s lineage and grasp the terrifying burdens Eva carried. She swore then and there she’d follow Eva for the rest of her adventure; if she could lighten Eva’s load even a little all her pains would be worth it.<br><br>
3.  Warrior: She’s a tough swordswoman out for vengeance. She finds Eva being swindled by a greedy innkeeper and after saving her, finding her and Ren travelling alone, decides not to leave them until they reach safely within the kingdom’s borders. Little did she know that she’d end up facing an ancient dragon and come face to face with the dark past she desperately wanted to forget…<br><br>
4.  Prince: A kind, resourceful and pragmatic man, he was hailed as the ‘miracle boy’ of the kingdom due to his wondrous ability to conjure anything he could imagine. However, when he was unable to prevent an accident from claiming the lives of many of his villagers, he lost all confidence in his abilities. Now, even lighting a candle is an exercise in frustration, and his situation isn’t helped by the illness of his father, the sudden disappearance of his mother and the mire of politics in the kingdom. Eva finds him in a remote town doing petty chores for the stand-in king, hiding despair and helplessness behind his warm smile.<br><br>
Villains:<br><br>
1.  Fallen hero: The hero Eva had selected. One morning he woke up to find his entire village had disappeared. He searched desparately for them and when he failed sought to find answers from the mythical time-masters. He did succeed in finding them, however, bound by their laws to not meddle in worldly affairs, they refused to help him. As he saw his last hopes fleeting, he found Eva. She saw great power within him and was suspicious of the actual cause of his troubles. So she promised she'd help search for his family after the Demon's threat was over. Little did she realise he was already being influenced by the demon, and his cosy village was just a figment of the demon's imagination... <br><br>
2.  Demon: Don’t judge him, the poor guy’s just hungry. Drifting between galaxies, our boss had just about lost hope when it spotted a tasty planet full of trees and clear streams, so it just had to cross dimensions to take a bite. However, he knew that if he was detected by the gatekeepers (time-masters) they would close the dimension and the planet would be out of reach, so he spun an elaborate illusion to hide it's true strength, making it seem harmless. By the time it was found out, it was too late… The entire clan fell for it, seeing futures concocted by the Demon, all except the one who was born well after the illusion was cast, Eva.<br><br></h2> 
<h2 id="Themes">Themes:<br><br>
1.  The underlying theme is one of loss. Her journey to deal with the Demon forces her to grow up and make difficult choices and sacrifices, ultimately even leading her to sacrifice her life.<br><br>
2.  Journey – the crew is taken on a journey to different and diverse places. This ‘hidden’ theme of journey has twofold significance – the first to gain familiarity with the cast, like when you read a good book and know the protagonist better than your brother. The second is cohesiveness, I want to see these 4 persons from wildly different walks of live bond together and transform into a big motley crew/family.<br><br>
3.  The theme visible on the surface is one of overcoming – the story of an eight year old hero facing overwhelming odds in the forms of unscrupulous magicians, dragons, and a conniving planet devouring monster that claims to have eaten her parents and clan. Each encounter causes her to lose something, tying back to the underlying theme of loss. <br><br>
